# New Colors Bootstrap
Add 4 new colors to Bootstrap 4 and new components.

## ALERT
These are experimental stylesheets I made while was learning SASS. I don't know if they are compatible with all browsers and I'd be very happy if you send me feedback.

## Diferences Between ncb.css and ncb.min.css
- ncb.css is formatted. (Good for know how works)
- ncb.min.css is in one line and weights less. (Faster, good for only use it)

## How To Use - Download
You can download the file you prefer (.css or .min.css) directly, copying the code and pasting it in your proyect or add the jsDelivr CDN (.css or .min.css, you pick)
~~~
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jebbarbas/newcolorsbootstrap/ncb.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jebbarbas/newcolorsbootstrap/ncb.min.css">
~~~
Don't forget to add the .js file too
~~~
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jebbarbas/newcolorsbootstrap/ncb.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jebbarbas/newcolorsbootstrap/ncb.min.js"></script>
~~~
You can put the &lt;script&gt; in the &lt;head&gt; or in the &lt;body&gt;, it doesn't matter 'cause I use the event 'DOMContentLoaded' to apply the JS.

## How To Use - Quick Start
You need first to have Bootstrap 4, this stylesheet doesn't contains Boostrap 4 styles, only new colors for them.
Once you have Bootstrap 4, use it normally, but you can use the colors: 'magic','juice','ocean' and 'cake', put them when normally you put 'primary' or 'success'

## Example
~~~
<button class="btn btn-magic">Magic Button</button>
<div class="alert alert-juice">Juice Alert</div>
<button class="btn btn-outline-ocean btn-sm">Small Outline Ocean Button</button>
~~~

## New Things
- 'magic' color.
- 'juice' color.
- 'ocean' color.
- 'cake' color.
- 'Callout' component.
- 'Sidebar' component.
- 'Circle' component.
- 'Circle-State' component.
## Note
I added also the SASS source code. Lov U All.
